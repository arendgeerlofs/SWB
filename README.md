# Subjective Well-Being (SWB) Simulation Repository

This repository contains code for simulating and analyzing subjective well-being (SWB) in the context of social networks, interventions, and resilience. The simulation models explore the dynamics of SWB, social capital, and other related factors across different network structures and intervention strategies.

## Getting Started

To get started with the SWB simulation, you need to have Python installed along with the required dependencies.

### Requirements

Used pacakges and their versions can be found in requirements.txt

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies using `pip`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arendgeerlofs/SWB.git
cd SWB
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running Simulations

To run the model under different settings and to find different dynamics, the functions in run.py can be used.

The `run_over_model` function runs the main simulation over different network structures and intervention strategies. 

```python
def run_over_model(constants, runs, its, visualisations=[], networks=["SDA"], title_add=""):
```

- `constants`: Dictionary containing constant parameters for the simulation.
- `runs`: Number of simulation runs.
- `its`: Number of iterations per run.
- `visualisations`: List of visualizations to generate (e.g., `["plot_agent", "plot_avg"]`).
- `networks`: List of network types to simulate (default is `["SDA"]`).
- `title_add`: Additional title for output files.

### Heatmap Analysis

The `run_two_var_heatmap` function generates heatmaps for SWB and change in SWB based on two varying parameters.

```python
def run_two_var_heatmap(constants, runs, its, samples, params, bounds, title_add="", hist_gap_comb=False):
```

- `constants`: Dictionary containing constant parameters.
- `runs`: Number of simulation runs.
- `its`: Number of iterations per run.
- `samples`: List containing the number of samples for each parameter.
- `params`: List of two parameters to vary.
- `bounds`: Bounds for the parameters.
- `title_add`: Additional title for output files.
- `hist_gap_comb`: Boolean indicating whether to combine history length and intervention gap.

### Resilience Analysis

The `run_resilience` function analyzes the resilience of the network under different intervention strategies and parameter settings.

```python
def run_resilience(constants, runs, its, param, bounds, samples, int_ts, int_factors, int_var, title_add=""):
```

- `constants`: Dictionary containing constant parameters.
- `runs`: Number of simulation runs.
- `its`: Number of iterations per run.
- `param`: Parameter to vary.
- `bounds`: Bounds for the parameter.
- `samples`: Number of samples.
- `int_ts`: List of intervention timesteps.
- `int_factors`: List of intervention factors.
- `int_var`: Intervention variable.
- `title_add`: Additional title for output files.

### Degree-SWB Analysis

The `run_degree_SWB` function examines the relationship between network degree and SWB.

```python
def run_degree_SWB(constants, runs, its, title_add=""):
```

- `constants`: Dictionary containing constant parameters.
- `runs`: Number of simulation runs.
- `its`: Number of iterations per run.
- `title_add`: Additional title for output files.

## Data Visualization

The repository includes functions for visualizing the results of the simulations, including agent plots, average plots, variance plots, histograms, and degree-SWB plots. These visualizations can be generated by setting the appropriate options in the `visualisations` parameter when running simulations.

## Model dynamics

The main structure of the model can be found in model.py, the update functions can be found in update.py, helper functions in functions.py and the initialisation functions in initialise.py.
